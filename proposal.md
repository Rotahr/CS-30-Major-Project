# Proposal
A puzzle game containing multiple smaller puzzles that arches into a bigger puzzle and/or code that wins you the game. Starting out as only a small simple application that takes your information and displays it on screen it slowly asks for more personal until the player decides to leave the game. The player then gets transported to a browser similar to google chrome. Upon attempting to leave the game the player is asked for a code to leave, but does not have access / does not yet know what said code is. There are multiple tabs within the browser which then contain the puzzle that will give you the code.
