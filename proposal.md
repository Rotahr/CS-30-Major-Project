# Proposal
<<<<<<< HEAD
A puzzle game containing multiple smaller puzzles that arches into a bigger puzzle and/or code that wins you the game. Starting out as only a small simple application that takes your information and displays it on screen it slowly asks for more personal until the player decides to leave the game. The player then gets transported to a browser similar to google chrome. Upon attempting to leave the game the player is asked for a code to leave, but does not have access / does not yet know what said code is. There are multiple tabs within the browser which then contain the puzzle that will give you the code. 

## Needs To Have:
### - ok

A puzzle game containing multiple smaller puzzles that arches into a bigger puzzle and/or code that wins you the game. Starting out as only a small simple application that takes your information and displays it on screen it slowly asks for more personal until the player decides to leave the game.

Upon attempting to leave the game the player is asked for a code to leave, but does not have access / does not yet know what said code is. There are multiple tabs within the browser which then contain the puzzles that will give you a letter when added all together give you the code. 

## Needs To Have:
- movement from title screen / information presenter to the actual puzzle game
- movement between tabs/games
- properly integrated code between games
- forced/encouraged fullscreen (as that's the only way the game's narrative would work)
- A believable browser setting
- Text on screen to secure users understanding of what's currently happening and what they must do in return
- a sense of desperation
  - can be done through text on screen, colors (red and black), 
### - At least 3 fully functioning puzzles/minigames (current ideas, * = 100% certainty)
  - Grid assignment Reoccuring Neighbors *
  - minigame against an ai
    - pong, tic tac toe, guessing game, chase something with your mouse
  - basic word puzzle *
  - Bigger puzzle requiring information from all the other tabs to solve 
### - Better Backend Developement
  - Optimized code
  - little to no reoccuring variables for improved readability
  - good readability
  - 
  
### Reoccuring Neighbors - tab 1
a series of 3x3 grids in which you must turn all squares either all black or all white. The grids move in and out of the screen so they can be properly displayed; upon completing all neighbor games the display zooms out, showing that the original 3x3 grids made a 3x3 grid themselves, displaying the first letter to the code.

### Word Puzzle - tab 2
Basic word puzzle which you must solve with no aid from the game, the puzzle itself will give you a letter. 
- nice to have within word puzzle:
  - a lot harder than a basic word puzzle, perhaps using sound from the computer or information from the other tabs to be able to solve it.
  
## Nice To Have:
- aesthetically pleasing
  - Screen glitches every so often
  - games have backgrounds, music, sound effects, etc
  - Color between tabs fit together
- Storyline
  - the game trying to escape your computer and you have a limited time to solve everything to shut down the game before it's done
- references to the information you put in at the beginning of the game
  - browser changes based on what you put in
  - recalls your name, age, etc to try to 'scare' you
- each tab looks like a destroyed website, with the game still functioning
