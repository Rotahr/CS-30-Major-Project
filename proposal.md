# Proposal
A puzzle game containing multiple smaller puzzles that arches into a bigger puzzle and/or code that wins you the game. Starting out as only a small simple application that takes your information and displays it on screen it slowly asks for more personal until the player decides to leave the game. The player then gets transported to a browser similar to google chrome. Upon attempting to leave the game the player is asked for a code to leave, but does not have access / does not yet know what said code is. There are multiple tabs within the browser which then contain the puzzle that will give you the code.

### Word Puzzle - tab 2
Basic word puzzle which you must solve with no aid from the game, the puzzle itself will give you a letter.

  - the game trying to escape your computer and you have a limited time to solve everything to shut down the game before it's done
- references to the information you put in at the beginning of the game
  - browser changes based on what you put in
  - recalls your name, age, etc to try to 'scare' you
- each tab looks like a destroyed website, with the game still functioning  
- writing text in infogame doens't include SHIFT and the such
